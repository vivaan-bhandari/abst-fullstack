## Summary
The main issues have been resolved:
1. **AI Engine Logic**: Fixed to use actual care hours instead of frequency indicators
2. **Day Names**: Fixed mismatch between backend (abbreviated) and frontend (full names)  
3. **Get Recommendations Button**: Now correctly calls weekly recommendations function
4. **Data Display**: Fixed day matching logic in the weekly recommendations grid
5. **Apply Weekly Recommendations**: Fixed day name mismatch in backend endpoint

The system should now properly:
- Display weekly shift recommendations for all days and shifts with care hours
- Allow users to apply weekly recommendations to create actual shifts
